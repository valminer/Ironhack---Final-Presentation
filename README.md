# How did 2020 music preferences change across the year? An analysis on Italian Spotify users.


## Project Intro/Objective:
The purpose of this project is to analyze the effect of covid on Italian Spotify users' music preferences. 


## Methods Used:
* Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling
* Machine Learning 
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

## Technologies:
* Python
* MySql
* Tableau
* Pandas, Jupyter, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Project Description:
The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize how italian Spotify users preferences changed in the course of the year. As the lockdown required a long period of staying at home, I thought it was interesting to check whether the users listened to more energetic or low-mood songs. In order to analyze this, I used the Spotify features and I observed their trend in the course of the year. The clustering also helped me visualize the trends in terms of combination of features, that could hint at music genre. Finally, I checked for seasonality by comparing the trends with the ones of the previous year.


## Further developments / Next Steps:
* The risk of strong assumptions is high: what is a sad or cheerful song? NLP might help. 
* Very little diversification in the playlist. Representative?
* Differences in the means between years. Significant?
